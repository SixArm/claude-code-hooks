# Clear scratch files

The `SessionEnd` event supports matchers on the reason the session ended. This
hook only fires on `clear` (when you run `/clear`), not on normal exits.

Add the content from here into `~/.claude/settings.json`, or use the interactive
way to configure it by using the Claude Code command `/hooks`.
